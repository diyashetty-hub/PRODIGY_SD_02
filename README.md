# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (GUI)

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using Python and Tkinter as part of my internship tasks.

In this game, the user has to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the app provides feedback whether the guess is:

* 🔻 Too Low
* 🔺 Too High
* ✅ Correct

The game also displays the total number of attempts taken once the correct number is guessed.

## 💻 Features

* User-friendly GUI built with **Tkinter**.
* Random number generation for every new game.
* Displays hint messages after each guess.
* Shows total attempts after winning.
* Option to start a new game anytime.
